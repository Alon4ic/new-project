				<p class="club-content"><strong>Joanne Rowling</strong> (born 31 July 1965), also known by her pen name
					J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist. She wrote a seven-volume children's fantasy
					series, Harry Potter,
					published from 1997 to 2007. The series has been enormously successful: it has sold over 500 million
					copies, been translated into at least 70 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including
					films and video games. The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults. She writes Cormoran
					Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, as Robert Galbraith.<br /><br />Born in Yate, Rowling
					graduated from the University of Exeter in 1987 and began working temp jobs as a bilingual
					secretary. In 1990, the idea for the characters of Harry Potter came to her while she waited on a
					delayed train. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother from multiple
					sclerosis, which deeply affected Rowling and her writing; the birth of her first child; and divorce
					from her first husband. She wrote the first Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's
					Stone (1997), while experiencing relative poverty as a single parent. Forbes named her the world's
					highest-paid author in 2008, 2017 and 2019.
